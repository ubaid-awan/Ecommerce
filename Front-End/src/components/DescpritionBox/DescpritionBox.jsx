            to checkout. At checkout, customers provide their shipping information and choose a payment method, such as a credit card, bank transfer, or digital wallet.Once the payment
            is confirmed, the business processes the order. The product is then packed and shipped to the customerâ€™s address. E-commerce platforms also offer features like order 
            tracking, customer support, easy returns, and personalized recommendations to enhance the shopping experience.
            E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, refers to the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. It allows businesses and customers to connect without the need for a physical store.
